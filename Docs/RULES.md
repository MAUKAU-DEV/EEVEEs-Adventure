## Code Base
### Code style rules
In this project we follow the microsoft C# coding conventions. If not explicitly named follow these instructions -> [Microsoft coding conventions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mixed-reality/world-locking-tools/documentation/howtos/codingconventions).

**Spaces vs Tabs**
Different to what is written in the [Microsoft coding conventions](#code-style-rules) we use a tap that is four spaces wide for indenting.

**Comments**
When adding or changing a function please make shure to write a simple comment with @param and @return values.
Look at [Anney D Documentation comments by Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/language-specification/documentation-comments) for more information and tutorials. 

### Documentaion
The documentation is in the wiki repositiory. The wiki is a direct mirrior of the file structure in the unity asset folder. For each file / class that is added, create a new wiki entry with the same name please.

### Tasks / Issues
Tasks will be made by the project team, and can be seen in the [projects roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/MAUKAU-DEV/projects/9/views/1).
In each task or issue will be a definition and description.

### Branches
The team will create branches for different features. But there is one big rule **DO NOT PUSH TO MAIN**.
The main branch is the release branch once the game is finished. Only push to the **DEV** branch. 

### How to contribute
Before contributing please read the [Game Design Documeent](GAME-DESIGN-DOCUMENT.md)!

If you want to contribute search through the issue tab and find one that you can fix, implement. Make shure that it is in the Todo section in the [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/MAUKAU-DEV/projects/9/views/1).
Write in the issue to "claim" it and start working. Once you finished the fix/implementation and wrote the documentaion (you can ask other community members for help) you can push the changes up and create a pull request. Other community members and the project team will review the changes and may aks you to change some things. Once everything works and all the changes are made, will the team push your branch to the dev branch.

### How to join the team?
You will be invited to join the team by other team members. You can increase your "repurtation" in the team by contributing.

### 3D Models / Sprites
Every 3D model or sprite needs to be validated that it does not conflict with copyright laws. We need to make shure we have the permissions / license to use it. Please keep that in mind. 
**If you are an artis you can donate your work to the project, please keep in mind that by doing so you will make your art open source under our license.**
